## Required Secrets

This chart requires that a values-secret.yaml file exists in your home directory for the pattern which is using this chart.

The file should be named `values-secret-<your_pattern_dir>.yaml` and placed in your home directory (NOT in the pattern repository where it would be committed to Git). The naming convention follows the pattern: `values-secret-<pattern_directory_name>.yaml`.

For example, if you have a pattern in the directory `rag-llm` locally, then this file should be located at `~/values-secret-rag-llm.yaml` and must contain at minimum a Hugging Face token for a user authenticated to use the model specified in the `model.repository` value.

```yaml
secrets:
  - name: huggingface
    fields:
    - name: token
      value: hf_xxxxxxxxxxx
```
